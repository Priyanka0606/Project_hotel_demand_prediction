# Hotel Booking Prediction

The aim of this project is to leverage guest data and booking behaviour patterns to devise a strategy for Hotel Revenue Management, using Data Science and Machine Learning.

Perform the EDA on variables:Explore the patterns formed by the variables and  try to draw insights from the inter variable relationships. Some key ideas that can be explored as a part of EDA are, do Cancellations differ by type of hotel? , do Cancellation Rates have a time trend?, what is relationship between Lead Time and Cancellation Rate Relate to each other?, etc.

Data pre processing is performed and bi directional approach i.e. both classifier algorithms(statistical and ML based) can be tried out and results compared for final deployment.

The classification performance of the machine learining models are measured using precision, recall, accuracy and f1 score.
